        <h2><b>Ingredients:</b></h2>
             <ul>
                <li>1 lb. spaghetti</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil,divided, or as needed</li>
                <li>8 slices of bacon</li>
                <li>1 onion</li>
                <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
             </ul>
        
            <h2><b>Instructions:</b></h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
                <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
                <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table</li>
            </ol>
